# raptor_sshtime - [Open]SSH remote timing attack exploit
# Copyright (c) 2006 Marco Ivaldi <raptor@0xdeadbeef.info>
#
# OpenSSH-portable 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately 
# sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote 
# attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack (CVE-2003-0190).
#
# OpenSSH portable 4.1 on SUSE Linux, and possibly other platforms and versions,
# and possibly under limited configurations, allows remote attackers to 
# determine valid usernames via timing discrepancies in which responses take 
# longer for valid usernames than invalid ones, as demonstrated by sshtime. 
# NOTE: as of 20061014, it appears that this issue is dependent on the use of 
# manually-set passwords that causes delays when processing /etc/shadow due to 
# an increased number of rounds (CVE-2006-5229).
# 
# This is a simple shell script based on expect meant to remotely analyze 
# timing differences in sshd "Permission denied" replies. Depending on OpenSSH 
# version and configuration, it may lead to disclosure of valid usernames. 
#
# Usage example: 
# [make sure the target hostkey has been approved before]
# ./sshtime 192.168.0.1 dict.txt
#

# Some vars
port=22

# Command line
host=$1
dict=$2
